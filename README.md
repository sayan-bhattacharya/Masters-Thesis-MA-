# Master’s Thesis: Design and Evaluation of an Autonomous Comparison Method for Feature Ranking for Machine Prognostics

## Overview

This repository contains the full text and supplementary materials for my Master’s thesis titled **"Design and Evaluation of an Autonomous Comparison Method for Feature Ranking for Machine Prognostics"**. This work was submitted to the Technische Universität Ilmenau, Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, as part of the requirements for the Master’s degree in Communications and Signal Processing.

## Abstract

The field of Feature Ranking (FR) deals with the task of finding a hierarchy of useful features in a given dataset. One practical application of FR is in predictive maintenance (PdM), where the health of machines is constantly monitored. As data-driven approaches become more popular, bringing Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions to embedded platforms becomes the next step in PdM. However, embedded platforms with limited resources require careful design, making the selection of features crucial to reduce overall model complexity. This thesis establishes a methodology to compare different FR algorithms, optimizing system performance when deployed on embedded systems. The methodology is tested on two datasets: PRONOSTIA, an open-source machine health diagnostics dataset, and a computer fan dataset prepared at IMMS GmbH. The results demonstrate that the proposed methodology offers detailed insights into which features aid performance, leading to a significant reduction in the number of features and a better strategy for system design in PdM applications.
